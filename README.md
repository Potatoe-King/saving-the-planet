were saving the planet yall

# Notes on files:
- run the website from index.html (this is automatically done on github, but if you're running it from personal ide, make sure to do this)
- css files customize the html; when importing files on your end, make sure you import the css files in the css folder and the js files in the js folder
- all animations + back-end go in the js file

# purpose of each html file:
- index.html: main page
- pick-animal.html: page where user picks which animal they want in their sim
- results.html: page where calculations and graph of populations are displayed. note: this is where front-end and back-end intersect
- rules.html: states the instructions of the sim
- attributions.html: we used pics from freepik and i dont wanna be sued for plagiarism

# all css files customize the corresponding html file with the same name. ex: index.css customizes index.html

# purpose of each js file:
heck idk bro
